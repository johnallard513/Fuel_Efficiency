# Fuel_Efficiency

For this project, I examined various characteristics of vehicles made between 1970-1982 to uncover their impact of fuel efficiency. My research primarily involved investigating engine size, cylinder count, and horsepower of various manufacturers and any trends that appear across model years. Due to the complex relationship between the features, I primarily PCA and tSNE techniques to examine the data.

My goals were to group similar vehicles into groups for customer segmentation  and advertising purposes for a ficiontal car dealership.
